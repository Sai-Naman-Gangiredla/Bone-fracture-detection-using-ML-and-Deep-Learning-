## 📖 How It Works

1. **Upload an X-ray image.**
2. **Validation:** The app checks if the image is a real X-ray using a pre-trained model and image analysis.
3. **Prediction:** The ML model predicts if the bone is fractured.
4. **Fracture Type:** If fractured, the app shows the likely fracture type, severity, and common locations.
5. **Confidence:** The app displays the model’s confidence in its prediction.
